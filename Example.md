Venkateś ran v-his fingers through v-his hair, trembling slightly as v-he considered what v-he was about to do. Mastering v-his courage, v-he stepped up to the door and knocked. When the door creaked open to reveal a short child with pale green hair v-he said "Hello! Is Alþ home?"

The child tilted b-his head, regarding Venkateś with a cool stare. "a-He's not here. a-He said that you would be stopping by in a bit, but a-he had to run out for a few moments to get something. a-He was blushing a lot when a-he said it, too."

"Oh! I see." Venkateś cast v-his eyes around the doorway. "Um . . . could I wait inside?"

"Sure." The child turned, waving Venkateś inside.

"Er. This is an awkward question. Are you [Below the Light of the Full Moon]? Or one of !b-his friends?"

[Below] gave Venkateś an incredulous look.
